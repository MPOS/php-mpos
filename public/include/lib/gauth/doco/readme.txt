The GA4PHP Project
==================

GA4PHP means Google Authenticator for PHP.

The purpose of this "library" is to provde a convienient and
hopefully simple way of provisioning and authenticating users
using the Google Authenticator mechanism. For now this lib
will only support GA's hotp methods.


Why?
====

Mostly cause I can. Recently i've been heavily interesting in
what is "out there" for FOSS based authentication projects and
the Google Authenticator is based on OATH - HOTP/TOTP. It also
has a few kewl features, like providing its secret key via QR
codes. But looking at the App's available for smartphones
(android, iphone, etc), the google auth app was the only one
that fullfilled some realistic criteria - easy to use, easy to
provision.


How To Use It?
