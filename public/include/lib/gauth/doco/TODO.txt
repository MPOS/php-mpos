The Almighty TODO list:

1) Error checking, lots of error checking and sanity checking Then i need to setup error codes and stuff.
1.1) put code comments in all the examples
3) implement googles key integrity algorithm thing
4) make better examples
5) turn the radius website into something more generic - i.e. "heres your provisioning site and how to support radius, but you could support anything"

Maybe:
Move to exceptions
