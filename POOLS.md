maybe this list will push you over the edge of decision making. Some
small and large pools are already running on it and have succesfully
tested it on various coins.

### WKNiGHT

WKNiGHT was an early adopter of `mmcfe-ng`. He has been around since a first stable release
which only featured proportional payouts. He successfully moved to PPS since then and is
running more or less without any issues (related to `mmcfe-ng` that is ;-)). He is also running
the most powerful pool!
