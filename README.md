Description
===========

mmcFE-ng is a web frontend for Pooled Mining.

This is based on mmcFE, the original work by Greedi:
https://github.com/Greedi/mmcFE

After working a few days trying to learn to run my own pool and the
systems behind it I figured I'd look a bit deeper in the code to
understand how it works. While doing so I also migrated the existing
code over to my own framework so maintenance would be easier in the
future.

Requirements
============

* PHP MySQLnd Driver
* MySQL Server
* pushpoold
* litecoind

Installation
============

No definite guide yet since this project is not in a working state as of
yet.

Disclaimer
==========

Since this is a heavy WIP there is no official support yet. The frontend
might work already but the entire backend (cronjobs) has not been
modified from the original yet and *will not work*. If you have a
working backend please get in touch with me - maybe with some
collaboration this project could be a great starting point for anyone
that likes to run their own pool.
