Description
===========

mmcFE-ng is a web frontend for Pooled LTC Mining.

The web frontend layout is based on mmcFE, the original work by Greedi:
https://github.com/Greedi/mmcFE

After working a few days trying to learn to run my own pool and the
systems behind it I figured I'd look a bit deeper in the code to
understand how it works. While doing so I also migrated the existing
code over to my own framework so maintenance would be easier in the
future.

**NOTE**: This project is still under development and commits are happening on a daily basis.
I do not recommend using this for a live setup as of yet. Wait for the later Release Candidate
if you wish to run your pool with it. Testing pools are much appreciated though!

Donations
=========

I was hoping to keep this out of the README but apparently people remove or change the LTC address
at the bottom of the page. For those of you finding my project and are willing to appreciate the work
with some hard earned LTC feel free to donate to my LTC address: `Lge95QR2frp9y1wJufjUPCycVsg5gLJPW8`

Requirements
============

This setup has been tested on Ubuntu 12.04, Ubuntu 13.04 and CentOS.
It should also work on any related distribution (RHEL, Debian).
For support on how to get `litecoind` or `pushpoold` to work, please ask
in the appropriate forums.

* Apache2
 * libapache2-mod-php5
* PHP 5.4+
 * php5-mysqlnd
 * php5-memcached
* MySQL Server
 * mysql-server
* memcached
* pushpoold
* litecoind

Features
========

The following feature have been implemented so far:

* Use of memcache for statistics instead of a cronjob
* Web User accounts
* Worker accounts
 * Worker activity (live, past 10 minutes)
 * Worker hashrates (live, past 10 minutes)
* Pool statistics
* Minimal Block statistics
* Pool donations
* Pool fees
* Manual payout with 0.1 LTC fee
* Auto payout with 0.1 LTC fee
* Transaction list (confirmed and unconfirmed)

Installation
============

Please ensure you fullfill the minimal installation requirements listed above
and install any missing packages or software.

Download Source
---------------

Download the (stable) master branch from Github:

```
git clone -b master git://github.com/TheSerapher/php-mmcfe-ng.git mmcfe-ng
```

Or, if you are not using git, use the ZIP file provided:

```
wget https://github.com/TheSerapher/php-mmcfe-ng/archive/master.zip
unzip master.zip
mv php-mmcfe-ng-master mmcfe-ng
```

Permissions
-----------

Please ensure your webuser (e.g. `www-data`, `apache`) has write access to
the `mmcfe-ng/public/templates/compile` folder! Otherwise compiled
templates can not be stored:

```
sudo chown www-data mmcfe-ng/public/templates/compile
```

Apache2 Configuration
---------------------

Please point your website document root to the `mmcfe-ng/public` folder
and enable auto-index for `index.php`.

Memcache
--------

Please install and start a default memcache instance. Not only would you
need one for `pushpoold` but the statistics page is storing data in
`memcache` as well to improve performance. Your memcache can be
configured in the global configuration file (see below).

Configuration
-------------

Please create the `mmcfe-ng/public/include/config/global.inc.php`
configuration from the supplied template
`mmcfe-ng/public/include/config/global.inc.dist.php`.

Pushpoold
---------

Please ensure the passwords are read from the proper table by adding this to your configuration:

```
  # database settings
  "database" : {
    "engine" : "mysql",
    "port"    : "3306",
    "name" : "mmcfeng_database_name",
    "username" : "someuser",
    "password" : "somepass",
    "sharelog" : true,
    "stmt.pwdb":"SELECT `password` FROM `workers` WHERE `username` = ?",
    "stmt.sharelog":"INSERT INTO shares (rem_host, username, our_result, upstream_result, reason, solution) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)"
  },

```

Database
========

Now that the software is ready we need to import the database.
You will find the SQL file in the `mmcfe-ng/sql` folder.
Import this file into an existing database and you should
have the proper structure ready.

TODO
====

I tried to cover most features available in mmcFE. There might be some missing still
(like graphs, some stats) but if you figure there is a core function missing please let
me know by creating an [Issue][1] marked as `Feature Request`.

Disclaimer
==========

This is a **WIP Project**. Most functionality is now added, the core
features are available and the backend cronjobs are working. I would not recommend
running this on a live pool yet. You can play around and test basic functionality but
wait for any live deployment for at least a stable Release Candidate.
