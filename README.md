Description
===========

mmcFE-ng is a web frontend for Pooled LTC Mining. A pool using this interface is running at http://pool.grewe.ca

The web frontend layout is based on mmcFE, the original work by Greedi:
https://github.com/Greedi/mmcFE

After working a few days trying to learn to run my own pool and the
systems behind it I figured I'd look a bit deeper in the code to
understand how it works. While doing so I also migrated the existing
code over to my own framework so maintenance would be easier in the
future.

**NOTE**: This project is still under development and commits are happening on a daily basis.
I do not recommend using this for a live setup as of yet. Wait for the later Release Candidate
if you wish to run your pool with it. Testing pools are much appreciated though!

Donations
=========

I was hoping to keep this out of the README but apparently people remove or change the LTC address
at the bottom of the page. For those of you finding my project and are willing to appreciate the work
with some hard earned LTC feel free to donate to my LTC address: `Lge95QR2frp9y1wJufjUPCycVsg5gLJPW8`

Pools running mmcfe-ng
======================

You can find a list of active pools [here](POOLS.md).

Requirements
============

This setup has been tested on Ubuntu 12.04, Ubuntu 13.04 and CentOS.
It should also work on any related distribution (RHEL, Debian).
For support on how to get `litecoind` or `pushpoold` to work, please ask
in the appropriate forums.

Be aware that `mmcfe-ng` is **only** for pooled mining. Solo Mining is not
supported. They will never match an upstream share, solo miners do not create
any shares, only blocks. Expect weird behavior if trying to mix them. See #299
for full information.
